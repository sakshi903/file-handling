# file-handling

1)extansion :-
We need to import the required modules.
So import os and shutil module.these are inbuilt modules, so don't need to install them.
And you need to create a variable called path which takes input of the directory path that you want to organize.
And then create a variable called files.
Which consists of a list of lines.
Now write a for loop condition.
Using for loop we traverse through every file from files.
The we spilt the filename and extension of the file.
We only need an extansion name so we remove the dot from the extension through slicing.
And then we need write to if statement.
If the extension directly already exits, then we move the file to that directory.
In else statement we make a new directory and then we move the file into it.
At the last lets runs the program......
After that you get your all saparate file in their respactive folder............

2)Category Wise:-

we don't need to download it from anywhere it's already inbuilt then we will create a basepath variable for the input of paths for files to organize  now we create a list in which which category we want to organize here I have organized category as vedios images and many more no
In the vedio if this extension exist then it will go in that category
